                <p class="content1"> 
                    This layout is based on the game Silent Hill 2. 
                    In that game, Pyramid Head was essentially a villain, although one can argue who the real antagonist was, it's safe to say that Pyramid Head was not a saint. This layout of Pyramid Head features many animations so for those who have dial-up or slower computers, be aware of the disadvantages. Note that the Pyramid Head on this layout was <u>NOT</u> based on the one in the movie, Silent Hill. It was specifically extracted from Silent Hill 2.

                <p class="content2"> 
                    The entire layout took a very long time to complete. I originally discovered an image of Pyramid Head standing in a foggy background filled with corpse hanging in "box-like" frames. I carefully extracted the image and animated it to make him appear as if he's breathing. If you look at him carefully, you would be able to see that on the banner. Next, I watched the entire FuKuRo video (which is a very explicit video of Pyramid Head... doing his business), and cut off a segment of it to put on the background. I wanted a scare factor to creep out viewers, so I've let a still image sit for ten seconds before animating the background which reveals Pyramid Head's entrance. I combined that footage with another of Pyramid Head skewering an offscreen character. On the banner, the "Misty Days" text could be edited. The text with "There Was a Hole Here" and "It's Gone Now" refers to an optional part of Silent Hill 2 where the message was written on the interior of a building. You can see it at imabearmeaw.com. You're probably wondering, "Why are there nine blank squares the navigation? It's annoying!" and I apologize if it is. It is also a huge reference to Silent Hill 2. Before going into battle with the twin Pyramid Heads, you will encounter nine save spots all perfectly aligned as shown on this layout.

                    Silent Hill 2 is an amazing game which I basically worship for its unique and brilliant story. The scare factor is there as well, and I have grown to love Pyramid Head. Through my eyes, the individual is more of an "executioner" who obeys what "God" or his master tells him. Of course, in Silent Hill, he could be a god as well. In other words, he is neutral to me. He is neither good nor bad; only exists as a punisher. My plans were to release this layout before Halloween to boost its popularity among those who do not like Silent Hill (after all, it IS a creepy layout!).
